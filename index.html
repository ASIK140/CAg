            <h1>Silver Impregnated Graphite Contacts</h1>
            <p>
              Silver Impregnated Graphite (SIG) contacts are used in high safety
              applications of railway signaling, traffic signaling, and numerous
              other applications due to high silver content that eliminates the
              risk of welding in the presence of graphite. High contact
              resistance (>200mÎ©) was observed in the SIG contacts in a railway
              signaling operation after a few thousand operations of the relay.
              The high contact resistance was discovered to be a result of loose
              dust/foreign particles residing between the two contacts. Silver
              had been preferentially removed from the contacting surfaces
              during switching operations by an abrading effect of the
              dust/foreign particles, leaving only graphite on the contact area.
              Wear was accentuated by the presence of porosity and low hardness
              of the contacts, leading to improper interaction between the
              mating surfaces.

            <h1>Silver Impregnated Graphite Heavy Duty Contacts</h1>
            <p>
              Silver Impregnated Graphite relay contacts combine the best
              properties of silver (electrical/thermal conductivity) and
              graphite (refractory nature) into a composite material.
              Distinctive features of the SIG material include its hard fusing
              characteristic, better conduction of heat and electricity, and
              easy brazing. Graphite carbon has high heat of vaporization and
              appreciably low material transfer in the localized high
              temperature spots developed during mating of contacts.
              Additionally, due to a high percentage of silver, the desired
              electrical properties are retained with practically no risk of
              welding. This combination of properties makes these contacts
              suitable for high safety applications such as railway signaling,
              traffic signaling, and numerous other applications.

              Cag Industries, a pioneering firm specializing in the
              manufacturing of Silver Impregnated Graphite Contacts, stands as a
              testament to years of dedication, technical expertise, and a
              commitment to excellence. Founded on a solid foundation of
              technical knowledge and experience garnered through systematic
              research, Cag Industries has emerged as a trusted provider of
              high-quality contacts for various railway signaling relay
              manufacturers and Indian Railways.
              <br />
              The journey of Cag Industries has been characterized by a
              relentless pursuit of technical proficiency and innovation. With a

              Silver Impregnated Graphite contacts are generally tested for
              dimensions, crushing strength, silver content, hardness, ash
              content, distribution of silver in the graphite matrix, contact
              resistance, X-ray mapping of silver, microstructure, life test,
              surface finish, and bulk density. The quality assurance of
              electrical contacts is often treated as an evaluation of
              "components in great quantity" and tested with statistical
              methods. This maybe the reasonable for the registration of
              fabrication defects, but consideration is also required for
              systematic failures related to specific materials, environmental
              influences during processing, application, and so forth. Failures
              caused by environmental influence occur late in the lifetime of
              the contact or component and may not be detected by early
              evaluations. Additionally, contamination on the surface of
              contacts and have deleterious effect on the contact and switching
              properties and may, in extreme cases, lead to early failure of
              devices.
